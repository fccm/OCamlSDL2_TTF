## Intro

OCamlSDL2_TTF brings you access to the SDL2_ttf library from OCaml.

## Current State

These relays are currently in a very early draft state.
You may expect to get segfaults.
These pieces of code are currently called "relays"
and not bindings while there is currently no memory
management and no integration with the garbage collector.

## Relicensing

If SDL_ttf changes its license in the future to any FLOSS / OSI approved
license, you can use these relays under the terms of the same license.
