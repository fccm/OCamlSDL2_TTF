description: """
An OCaml interface to the SDL2_ttf library.

SDL2_ttf is a TrueType font rendering library that is used with the SDL2 library,
and almost as portable.
It depends on freetype2 to handle the TrueType font data.
It allows a programmer to use multiple TrueType fonts without having to code
a font rendering routine themselves.
With the power of outline fonts and antialiasing, high quality text output
can be obtained without much effort.

This version of the bindings is known to work with SDL2_ttf version
2.0.15
